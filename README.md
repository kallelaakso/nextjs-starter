# NextJS starter

This is my starting boilerplate for developing NextJS application. It is basically just an empty NextJS project 
with some of my favorite tools I tend to add to each project

The following tools are included:

* TypeScript
* React Context API
* Styled Components
* eslint & prettier
* date-fns
* jest

## Scripts

To run dev server:

`$ npm run dev` 

To build a dist version:

`$ npm run build`

To run a dist version:

`$ npm run start`

To check types with typescript:

`$ npm run type-check`

To format code with Prettier:

`$ npm run format`

To run tests:

`$ npm run test`
